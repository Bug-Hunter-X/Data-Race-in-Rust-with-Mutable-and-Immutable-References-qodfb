This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust involving data races that can occur when mutable and immutable references overlap.  The `bug.rs` file shows the problematic code, and `bugSolution.rs` provides a corrected version that avoids data races.  The core issue is improper management of borrowing, leading to undefined behavior. Understanding how borrowing works in Rust is essential for writing safe and reliable code. This example highlights the importance of carefully considering reference lifetimes and mutability to avoid unexpected results.
